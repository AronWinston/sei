# Introduction to Data Structures using Javascript

## Definition

_A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data_

## Why Use Objects

_Objects provide us with a lot of power in how we organize our information because we are developers can decide the structure and behavior of code that is related together_

## Caveats

- Objects can be more work initially because you have group your code into constraints and classification hierarchies
- Object oriented design can get complicated

## Examples

- Object literal (sometimes seen as hashes in other languages)
- Object
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Linked List
- Blockchain
